# Digital Signal Processing Lab For ETC - 06 (And others)
Contains DSP Lab Codes File(MATLAB Files) Output image(Portable Network Graphics) and lab report(Portable Document Files)

* Expt 1 dated 23/12/2020 main file in lab23122020/main.m
* Expt 2 dated 06/01/2021 main file in lab06012021/

These are run sucessfully on *MATLAB* compiler may need a few tweaks and changes in the codes while running in Octave.

#Frequent Errors.
1. If compiler give error: Invalid Expressions. Make sure that your input sequence is enclosed by brakets (3rd brakets). Eg [1, 2, 3, 4] not 1,2,3,4 nor 1 2 3 4
2. If compiler give error:
